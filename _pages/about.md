Welcome!

I am Alessandro Fagnani, a Machine Learning Engineer working at [DataHow](https://www.datahow.ch). 
My work is focused on developing Digital Twin solutions and reaserching on Transfer Learning methods.


Since I was 10 years old, I have always been fascinated by computers and how they work. From then
on, I knew who I wanted to become, with my first computers, my first Linux operating systems, and
my first programming books. I have been a chess teacher for many years, and from this field, I learned
the patience and perseverance in finding a good solution to different difficult problems, and that is also
one of the reasons I found Artificial Intelligence an interesting subject too.
AI is where I am specialized and, even though Machine Learning, in general, is a trending topic now, I
am still looking at it with the same interest that my kid's eyes had from the beginning.
