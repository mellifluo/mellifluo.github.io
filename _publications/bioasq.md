title: "Transformer Models for Question Answering at BioASQ 2019"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/bioasq
excerpt: 'We describe our experiments in building a system to tackle task B of the BioASQ 2019 challenge on semantic question answering. We built separate systems to handle the five different types of questions in the dataset. We explored using transformer-based models using both ELMo, BERT and BioBERT. For the yesno questions, the results of our submissions using BERT ranked first in batches 3 and 4, while second best in batch 5.'
